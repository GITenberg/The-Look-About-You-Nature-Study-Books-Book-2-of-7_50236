<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This little book should be used as a simple guide to
the practical study of Nature rather than as a mere reader.</p>
<p>Every lesson herein set down has, during the author&rsquo;s
many years&rsquo; experience in teaching Nature Study, been
taught by observation and practice again and again;
and each time with satisfactory result. The materials
required for the lessons are within everybody&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>There is nothing that appeals to the heart of the
ordinary child like <i>living things</i>, be they animal or
vegetable, and there is no branch of education at the
present day that bears, in the young mind, such excellent
fruit as the study of the simple, living things around us.</p>
<p>Your child is nothing if not curious. He wants to
understand everything that lives in his bright little world.</p>
<p>Nature Study involves so many ingenious little deductions,
that the reasoning powers are almost constantly
employed, and intelligence grows proportionately. The
child&rsquo;s powers of observation are stimulated, and his
memory is cultivated in the way most pleasing to his
inquiring nature. By drawing his specimens, no matter
how roughly or rapidly, his eye is trained more thoroughly
than any amount of enforced copying of stiff, uninteresting
models of prisms, cones, etc., ever could train it.</p>
<p>The love of flowers and animals is one of the most
commendable traits in the disposition of the wondering
child, and ought to be encouraged above all others. A
few lessons on Nature Phenomena are added.</p>
<p>It is the author&rsquo;s fondest and most sanguine hope
that his little pupils may study further the great book
of Nature, whose broad pages are ever open to us, and
whose silent answers to our manifold questions are
never very difficult to read.</p>

<h1 title="">&ldquo;LOOK ABOUT YOU.&rdquo;
<br /><span class="small">BOOK II.</span></h1>
<h2 id="c1">I.&mdash;HOW PLANTS TAKE FOOD FROM THE SOIL (1).</h2>
<p>Uncle George had taught his little friends
many things from what he called the Book of
Nature, and what they had learnt made them
eager to know more.</p>
<p>One day as Dolly, the boys, and Uncle
George were in the garden they saw that a
tulip, which the day before was in full bloom
and strong, was now lying dead on the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little tulip!&rdquo; said Dolly. Both the
boys were sorry too. They had watched it
come through the ground like a blade of
grass, open out its bud, and expand its
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
bloom. Now all was over. The little flower
would no longer enjoy the bright sunshine or
the rain. It would no longer send forth its
rootlets in search of the food it so much
liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought, Dolly, how the
tulip, and indeed all plants, take their food
from the soil?&rdquo; asked Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they <i>must</i> feed in some way,&rdquo;
said Dolly, &ldquo;or they would not grow. But I
do not know how they do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like to know, Dolly?&rdquo; asked
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I should,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>
<p>The boys were just as eager as Dolly to
know about this, so Uncle George and the
children went indoors for a lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you how plants take their
food from the soil without first of all showing
you what happens when water and soil
are mixed together in a tumbler,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;Tom will fetch me a tumbler, and
you, Frank, bring me a little water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When these were brought, Uncle George
put a spoonful of soil into the tumbler, and
then poured some water on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stir it up, please, Dolly,&rdquo; said Uncle
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
George, &ldquo;and you may pretend you are going
to make a pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dolly did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us put it aside for a few minutes,
while we place the flowers we have gathered
into the vases,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Then
we will look at our tumbler of muddy water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How pretty the flowers were made to
look! How fresh they were! and how pleasant
was their scent! The children hardly thought
of the tumbler, but Uncle George was ready
now for the lesson.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/illus008.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="501" />
<p class="caption">Glass of Mud and Water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look, at the tumbler,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Do you see
a change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we do,&rdquo; said all
the children in one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mud has sunk to
the bottom of the glass,&rdquo;
added Tom, &ldquo;and the water
on the top is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George poured some
of the clear water into a
clean flat dish. Then he took a spirit-lamp
from a little cabinet, and heated the water
in the dish with it.</p>
<p>The children watched to see what would
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
happen. Soon a cloud was seen over the
dish, and by and by all the water had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is that at the bottom of the
dish?&rdquo; asked Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like powder,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it must have been in the water all
the time,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/illus009.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="499" />
<p class="caption">Evaporating Salt Water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet the water was
clear,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;Look once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Uncle George
took a glass of clean water
from the tap. He put two
large spoonfuls of salt in, and
stirred it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
salt has gone from sight.
Still the water is clear.
Where has it gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the water,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>Uncle George put more salt in the water,
and stirred it up. He kept on doing this
until the water would take up no more salt,
no matter how much it was stirred. This he
called <i>brine</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank, please go and ask mother
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
for a fresh egg,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you, Tom,
please bring me some fresh water in another
glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/illus010.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Egg floating in Salt Water.</p>
</div>
<p>Uncle George placed
the egg in the glass in
which the salt had been
put, and it floated in it.
He then placed the egg in
the glass of fresh water,
and it at once sank to the
bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you explain this!&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The salt water is
heavier and thicker than the fresh water.
That is why it bears up the egg,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very good indeed, Frank. That
is just the reason. The salt water or brine
is <i>denser</i>, or heavier, than the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George next took a glass tube
with a thistle-shaped bulb at the end of
it. Frank kept his finger on the small
end, while his uncle poured some of the
brine into the bulb. He next tied a piece of
bladder skin over the bulb, and placed it in
a glass of fresh water, so that the salt water
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
in the tube was at the same level as the
fresh water in the glass.</p>
<p>Then he took two small glass bottles. He
filled one with fresh water and the other with
brine, and tied a piece of bladder skin over
the mouth of each. The one which was filled
with brine he placed in a larger dish of fresh
water. The other, that is the one filled with
fresh water, he placed in a dish of brine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children, we will go and have tea,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and when we come back we will
see if any change has taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About an hour later Uncle George, Dolly,
and the boys came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;look, Uncle George!
The water has risen up in the thistle tube.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how do you account for that,
Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the fresh water has passed
through the skin,&rdquo; Frank answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now taste the water in the glass outside
the skin,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;It was fresh
water when we put it in, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank did so. Tom tasted it too. Both
boys declared that it was now salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the salt taste come from?&rdquo;
their uncle asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have come through the skin,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then some of the salt water in the
thistle tube has passed through the skin into
the glass; and some of the fresh water in the
glass has passed through the skin into the
thistle tube. Can you tell me any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank thought for a little while and then
said, &ldquo;Oh yes, more fresh water than salt
water has passed through the skin, because
the salt water is now far up the tube.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, my boy. Now let us look
at the small bottles. The skin on the one
filled with brine is swollen out like a ball,
while the water in the dish tastes salt. The
skin of the other is drawn far in, showing us
that much of the fresh water which it contained
has passed out. If you taste the
water in this bottle, you will find that a very
little of the brine in the dish has passed into
it through the skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what we learn from these things is
really this&mdash;that when two liquids, a heavy
and a light one, are separated by a thin skin,
they <i>both</i> pass through the skin. The heavy
liquid passes through slowly, and the light
liquid passes through quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Uncle George then placed some small
seeds on a piece of wet blotting-paper. He
turned a glass tumbler upside down, and
placed it over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will leave these for a few days,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<h3>Questions and Exercises.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Boil some river-water in a flat dish until all the water is gone. Do the same with some sea-water, or, if this is not at hand, make some brine. Examine the two dishes, and tell what you see.</dt>
<dt>2. Take a glass gas chimney, and tie a piece of bladder, or parchment, over one end of it. Half fill it with sugar and water. Now place it with its tied-up end bottommost in a tumbler of clear cold water. After an hour or so taste the water in the tumbler. What have you to say about it?</dt>
<dt>3. What takes place when brine and clear water are separated from one another by a piece of skin (parchment)?</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c2">II.&mdash;HOW PLANTS TAKE FOOD FROM THE SOIL (2).</h2>
<p>A whole week went by before Uncle
George was ready for the next lesson.</p>
<p>At last he called the children and said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;Tom, will you please fetch me the
seeds which we put on the wet blotting-paper
under the tumbler? Frank, bring me
two leafy branches from a rose-bush in the
garden; and, Dolly, please fetch two glasses
from the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was nothing the children liked
better than to help their Uncle George, and
all three rushed off at once to do his
bidding.</p>
<p>While they were away Uncle George himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
went into the garden, dug up two young
plants, and brought them to the children in
the study.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="499" />
<p class="caption">Sun-flower Plant in Water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we
are ready to begin our lesson. Fill one of
the glasses with water, Frank, and put one
of your leafy rose branches in each glass&mdash;one
branch in water and
the other in a dry glass.
Can you tell me what will
happen to the branches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children had many
times seen what had happened
to flowers when the
maid had forgotten to put
water in the vases, so that
Tom readily said, &ldquo;Yes, the
one in the dry glass will
wither, while the one in the
water will keep fresh for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it always happens, Uncle,&rdquo; said
Frank. &ldquo;Why, sometimes the flowers we
gather in the wood are faded before we get
home. They often come back to life when
put in water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, Frank,&rdquo; Uncle
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
George replied. &ldquo;See, here are two young
sun-flower plants, which I brought in from
the garden. I
placed one in
water. The other
I left lying on
the table. The
one on the table
is dead. What
does this show us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/illus016.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="258" />
<p class="caption">The Sun-flower, faded.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That plants require water,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;That whenever you cut off their water
supply they die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Tom. We shall see by and
by that plants are always giving off a great
deal of water to the air from their leaves.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Where do they get this water from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be from the soil,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;If we
keep a plant in a pot without watering it, it
soon dies. All the water it contains will by
and by travel up to the leaves. It passes
out through tiny pores in the leaves into the
air. If no more water comes up from the
soil, the plant withers and dies. The roots of
plants search the soil in all directions for
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
water. And in this water there is but little
plant-food. We saw this when we boiled
away the clear water which covered the soil
in the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we boil away some water from the tap,
we shall find some solid matter left behind in
the dish. Thus we see that in order to get
a <i>small</i> quantity of food, plants take up a
<i>great</i> quantity of water from the soil. Most
of the water is sent into the air from the
leaves. But the food stuff remains in the
plant, just as it did in the dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am going to show you how this
water gets into the plant. Look at these
little seeds on the damp blotting-paper!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each seed has a small plant with a long
root, and small, stout green leaves. Look at
the roots and tell me what you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are covered with silky stuff,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now take this glass, which will
make things look bigger than they really are,
and look at the roots once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silky stuff is a number of fine hairs,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite right, Frank,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;These are the <i>root-hairs</i>. Each of
these hairs is a long bag or sac, of very thin
skin. It is filled with a liquid called <i>sap</i>,
which is slightly denser, or heavier, than the
water in the blotting-paper. Now, do you see
how a plant takes food from the soil, when it
is growing in the garden or in a field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I do,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;The
water in the soil contains very little plant-food.
The water inside the tiny sac contains
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you to say, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these liquids is denser than the
other,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Both are separated by a
thin skin. The lighter liquid outside the sac
will pass into it quickly, while the heavier
liquid will pass out slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Tom!&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t have given a better reply myself.
The water from the soil passes in quickly.
The sap from the inside of each root-hair
passes out slowly. If they were both of the
same density, neither would pass through the
skin. If the water in the soil were the
denser, then the sap would pass out so
quickly that the plant would soon be robbed
of its water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two young plants, each growing
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
in a small pot. I want you to water
them, Tom. Water one with salt and water
(brine), the other with tap-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did as he was asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="459" />
<p class="caption">Plants watered with Fresh and Salt Water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;the one which
you watered with brine is drooping. It is
bending over the pot. That is because the
water outside its root-hairs is denser than
that which is inside the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;How does the water get up from the
roots to the leaves?&rdquo; Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in the same way as the oil travels
up the wick of the lamp. Water will always
travel up through small spaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George poured some red ink into a
saucer, and dipped the corner of a lump of
sugar into it. The red ink ran up into the
sugar until it was red all over. Next he
took a bundle of very small glass tubes, and
dipped the ends of them in the ink. The
ink ran up the tubes, filling them to the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside every plant,&rdquo; Uncle George went
on, &ldquo;there are thousands of long tiny tubes,
up which the water travels. In fact the <i>veins</i>
of a leaf are just bundles of tubes, something
like the bundle I hold in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3">III.&mdash;THE WEASEL AND THE OTTER.</h2>
<p>It was Frank who wanted to follow the
stream far up towards the hills. He wished
to see where it began, for he had heard that
its source was in several small streams many
miles away.</p>
<p>Uncle George agreed to take the children
as far up the stream as they could walk,
without being tired. Soon they were far up
above the wood, and the fields, and the
pond.</p>
<p>Frank was not in the least sorry when
his uncle sat down on a large stone by the
side of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not go much farther,&rdquo; said
Uncle George. &ldquo;Some other day we will.
But tell me what you think of the country
round about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very wild and lonely,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;There are no fields of corn; nothing but
green hills and moorland. Yet it is very
grand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;The flowers and plants are not like those
of the valley,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The stream, too,
is different. Here it is a noisy, rushing
course of clear, lovely water. Down below
it is a lazy-flowing stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always so clear,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;After heavy rains this stream is
swollen and brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; cried Dolly. &ldquo;What is
that on the other side of the stream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough there was something moving
about. Now it turned round and opened its
mouth, showing two rows of sharp, white
teeth. Then, with a harsh cry that could
be heard above the noise of the water, it
bolted away.</p>
<p>There was just time for all to see the
creature, which Tom at once called a weasel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a weasel it is,&rdquo; said Uncle George;
&ldquo;it is one of the animals which prey on
rabbits and young hares. Look! there it
is again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children looked, and saw it quite
clearly. There it was, a pretty little animal
of a black and brown colour, with just a
little white on its breast. It sat up, and was
holding something in its fore paws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;our little
friend is a thief. He has found a nest, and
that is an egg he has stolen from it. Let us
see what he will do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="417" />
<p class="caption">The Weasel at Home.</p>
</div>
<p>In a moment or two Master Weasel
tucked the egg under his chin and was off
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dear little thing, to be sure!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
said Dolly. &ldquo;How quaint to carry an egg
in that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks pretty, that is certain,&rdquo; said
Uncle George, &ldquo;but it is a dreadful foe to
the smaller animals of the field. There are
other foes, too, and I hope we may see some
of them before we return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were glad to hear their uncle
say this, and they asked him to take them,
now they were rested, a little farther up the
stream.</p>
<p>All of them made a start.</p>
<p>By and by they came to a place where
the stream made a kind of pool. The pool
was bounded on each side by high rocks. At
the top end the water came down with a
rush from a great height.</p>
<p>It was a very lonely spot indeed; and,
except for the noise of the water, nothing
could be heard.</p>
<p>On and on they went.</p>
<p>Uncle George told them of the stoat, the
polecat, and the marten, all of which, he
said, were foes of the smaller animals.</p>
<p>Tom kept a sharp look out, and hoped he
would see at least one of these.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, a dull splash was
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
heard in the water a little way in front of
them. All of them looked towards the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, boys, down! and keep quite still,&rdquo;
said Uncle George. &ldquo;Hide behind these big
stones. We shall have a treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swimming on the surface of the water
was an animal as large as a good-sized dog.
Now it dived to the bottom. The ripples on
the water showed that the animal was
swimming underneath. The children held
their breaths and watched. Not in vain; for
there, on the other side of the stream, the
animal came out of the water. It held a fish
which it had caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we have a
fine chance to look at our new friend. That
animal is the otter. See! Its body is pretty
flat; its legs are short, and its toes are
webbed like those of the duck. Look at its
round nose and its small ears. If we were
closer to it we should see that there is a
fold of skin which can be turned over the
ears while the creature is in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fierce it looks!&rdquo; broke in Dolly,
&ldquo;and how its eyes gleam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is glad to have caught the fish, I
should think,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Uncle George raised his hand to hold the
children in silence. Then he went on in a
soft voice. &ldquo;Look at its flat tail, which is
pointed at the tip. The otter uses his tail
as a rudder to guide him in the water. See
how sleek his dark brown skin is. It is now
nearly dry, though he has only just come out
of the stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us drive him away,&rdquo; said Dolly, who
could not help but feel sorry for the poor
fish.</p>
<p>There was no need for this, however, as,
just at that moment, the otter turned towards
the party, showing, as he did so, a lovely
white throat. He had heard them speaking,
and was off like a flash, leaving the fish on
the rock.</p>
<p>The fish had an ugly bite in its back, and
was quite dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, dear little thing!&rdquo; cried Dolly.
&ldquo;What a shame to kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the otter&rsquo;s nature,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;He does a great deal of good,
for he kills many water-voles, or rats, as they
are sometimes called, as well as frogs and
water insects. Sometimes, however, he does
harm, for he catches salmon, trout, and wild-ducks.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
He seems to do this more for sport
than for food, for he only eats small portions
of his prey.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Common and Ox-eye Daisy compared.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV.&mdash;DWELLERS IN THE CORN FIELD.</h2>
<p>As Uncle George walked by the edge of
the corn field, Dolly and her two brothers ran
up to him. Dolly carried a bunch of huge
daisies in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to tell us about these,
Uncle George,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tom says that
these are the little field daisies grown up;
and Frank says they are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank is right,&rdquo; said Uncle George,
laughing. &ldquo;This is not the common field
daisy. It is the <i>ox-eye</i> daisy. You might
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
bring me a common daisy, Frank. I am
sure there are many growing near. Ah, here
is one at our feet! Now let us hold them
side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see that they are unlike one
another in many ways. The <i>ox-eye</i> daisy has
much larger leaves and flowers. It bears its
leaves and flowers on tall, strong stalks. The
leaves of the common daisy lie almost flat on
the ground, and there is only one little flower-head
on each stalk. When we get home we
shall look at them both more closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look at those big yellow daisies
growing among the corn,&rdquo; said Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I see some blue flowers near them,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yellow flower is the <i>moon-daisy</i>. It
is also called the <i>corn-marigold</i>. It is a great
deal like the two daisies we have just been
talking about. The other is the blue <i>cornflower</i>.
It belongs to the same great family
as the daisies. Frank will go and fetch us
some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank gathered a bunch of both flowers.
He was just reaching over for some large red
poppies when he saw a pair of small black
cunning eyes peering at him. Then a brown
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
creature ran past him and went out of sight
among the long grass at the edge of the
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rat! a rat! Uncle George!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a rat, I saw it,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is he doing out in the fields?&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;I always thought that rats
lived in houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brown rat lives where he can,&rdquo; said
Uncle George. &ldquo;Very likely this one has
come from the farm. Farm-yard rats often
come out and live among the long grass and
reeds in summer-time. When the cold
weather comes, and the crops are gathered,
they go back to the stables and barns.
There they rob the farmer. They are very
cunning creatures. They steal eggs, milk,
grain, and even kill and carry away young
chickens. The rat lives by thieving. That is
why he is killed whenever he shows his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats are sometimes useful, though. They
swarm in ship docks and places where stuff
is left about. They eat up what would rot
and poison the air. They thus help to keep
down disease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, before we go home I am
going to show you something. I found it the
other day when taking a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George led the children to the end
of the field, and pointed to a strange object
among the corn. It was a nest of some
sort. It was made of dried grass, and hung
from five or six wheat stalks. It was
round like a cricket-ball, and just about
as big.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the nest of the harvest-mouse,&rdquo;
said Uncle George in a low voice. &ldquo;Keep
still, and perhaps we shall see Mistress
Mousie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children waited a long time looking
at the curious little object. At last a tiny
brown creature ran up one of the wheat
stalks and went into the nest. It seemed to
go right through the wall of its little house.
There was no hole to be seen where it went
in. Then Uncle George clapped his hands.
At once two wee brown mice came out.</p>
<p>They slid down the corn stalks and were
out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Mr and Mrs Mousie, we have
disturbed you,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;We will
now go nearer and see your nest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see where they came out,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;There is no hole to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George pointed out to the children
how the nest was woven together and fixed
to the wheat stalks. He then took a pencil
from his pocket and moved aside some of the
dried grass. The children looked in and saw
a family of naked little mice cuddled up
together. They could not tell how many
there were; but Uncle George said that there
were eight or nine young ones as a rule in a
harvest-mouse&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will become of these wee mice
when the corn is ripe?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will perhaps be grown up and able
to take care of themselves by that time,
Tom,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The harvest-mouse stores up corn in its
nest. Before winter comes it makes a hole
in the ground. Here it sleeps through most
of the winter and spring. It wakes up from
time to time and feeds upon its store of
grains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much smaller and browner than our
house-mouse,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frank, it is our smallest four-footed
animal. We have many kinds of mice in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
country. The brown rat is the largest and
the harvest-mouse is the smallest of our
mouse family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it manage to slide down the
wheat stalk so quickly without falling off?&rdquo;
Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can use its long tail as well as its
feet for climbing,&rdquo; his uncle answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it wishes to get to the ground it
just coils its little tail round the stalk and
slides down.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c5">V.&mdash;HARVEST TIME.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They are very busy here,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, as he went into the field with Frank,
Tom, and Dolly.</p>
<p>And well might he say so, for the <i>whirr</i> of
the reaping-machine could be heard far away.
Round the field it went, sweeping down the
golden wheat. Following behind it were
several girls, who twisted bands of straw
and laid them on the ground. Behind these
came women who quickly gathered up the
cut wheat and placed it in bundles upon the
bands. Then came men who bound these
bundles into sheaves and tossed them aside.
After these, again, came men who caught
up the sheaves and placed them upright in
bunches of six or eight. These bunches of
sheaves they called &ldquo;<i>stooks</i>.&rdquo; Last of all came
a huge rake drawn by horses, gathering up
all the straws that were left. Every now
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
and then the man that guided the rake
pressed an iron bar, and, whenever he did
so, all the teeth of the rake rose up at once,
and left a row of gathered straw on the field.
Then a man came and bound them into rough
sheaves as before.</p>
<p>All was work and bustle and noise. What
with the whirr of the reaping-machine, the
girls singing as they worked, the larks singing
in the sky, and the glorious autumn
sun, the children thought the harvest-field
was the most cheerful place they had ever
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; Frank asked a
man who was fixing up the stooks. &ldquo;Would
it not be just as well if you left the sheaves
lying on the ground until you cart them
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, Master Frank,&rdquo; said the man,
who knew him well, &ldquo;that would never do.
We must allow the corn time to get dry, so
we place the sheaves upright that the sun
and wind may dry them; and so that any
rain that falls may run down the stalks
to the ground. When the sheaves are
quite dry, we take them home to the stack-yard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long does that take?&rdquo; Frank
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all depends on the weather,&rdquo; the man
replied. &ldquo;If it keeps fine, they will be dry
within a week. In rainy weather, sometimes
the sheaves have to stand in the fields for
some weeks. In the next field the crop was
cut a week ago. They are taking it home
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/illus044.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" />
<p class="caption">The Stack-yard.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you build the sheaves into great
stacks there?&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is kept in stacks until we are
ready to thresh it. You must all come over
to the farm and see it being threshed into
grain and straw some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you build it into stacks?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that we may keep it through the
winter, and thresh a stack at a time as we
need it,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;It is threshed
by passing it through a mill. At our farm
the mill is turned by horses. At some farms
there are mills turned by a great water-wheel.
Sometimes a steam-engine comes and threshes
the whole crop in the fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do with it when it is
threshed?&rdquo; Dolly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the corn is passed through the
mill, it is so shaken up that all the grain is
removed from the stalks. The grain comes
out at one side of the mill and falls into
sacks. The straw is tossed out at another
part. We use the straw for bedding for
horses and cows, and some kinds of straw
we use for feeding them. The grain goes to
the miller, who grinds it into flour. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
flour goes to the baker, who bakes it into
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys!&rdquo; Uncle George
shouted from the next field. &ldquo;We are going
over to the farmyard to see the stacks
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next field the farmer&rsquo;s men were
loading a waggon with sheaves of corn. The
sheaves were caught up by long pitch-forks
and tossed on to the waggon. Here a man
put them into a great square load. When
this was done, the men lifted Dolly up, and
she rode up to the farmyard on the top of
the great load of sheaves.</p>
<p>In the stack-yard a large round stack was
being built. A wooden frame was in the
middle, and round this a man put the sheaves
in a circle as they were thrown to him from
the waggon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;Dolly
wants to know why sheaves are made with
all the ears of corn at one end. Can you
tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is easy,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The
sheaves have to stand in the field for a long
time to dry. They could not stand up so
well if they were made any other way. Besides,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the ears of corn must be up from the
ground, or they would be broken off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another reason,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;Look how the stack is being
made. The top, or grain end of the sheaf is
inside. The outside of the stack is made up
of the cut ends of the straws. Thus the
grain is kept secure from bad weather and
thieving birds. Besides, the stack could not
be made round in shape if they were placed
in any other way. The bottom of the sheaf
is much wider than the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another part of the yard men were busy
roofing the newly built stacks with straw.
The straw roof was tied down with many
ropes, also made of twisted straw, and then
the stack was ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of work there is in getting
corn,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;much more
work than we have seen to-day. Think of
the work done in the fields in spring, getting
the land ready for seed&mdash;the work of ploughing,
sowing, reaping, and threshing done by
the farmer&rsquo;s men and horses&mdash;the work done
by the rain and sun in growing and ripening
the wheat&mdash;the work done by the miller and
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
baker; and all this, Frank, that we may have
a loaf of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Questions and Exercises.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Tell the story of a wheat plant from the time it begins to grow from the seed until it is ready to be cut.</dt>
<dt>2. Where does the making of a loaf of bread really begin? From what you have learnt in the lesson, trace the history of a loaf of bread.</dt>
<dt>3. Make a list of crops grown on the farm, and tell the use of each.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI.&mdash;THE SQUIRREL.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! there he goes again,&rdquo; said Frank,
as he watched a nimble little animal leaping
from branch to branch, and from tree-top to
tree-top. &ldquo;He will fall if he does not take
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;His home is among the tree-tops. He
never falls. That is a squirrel, and I should
not be surprised if his nest is somewhere
near. Let us sit down on this bank and
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Uncle George took his pair
of field-glasses out of the leather case which
he sometimes carried on a strap across his
shoulder, when he went out to watch the
birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr Squirrel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can
watch your antics from a distance. You are
a very cunning and clever little chap, no
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>When Uncle George and Dolly and the
two boys first saw the squirrel, the little
creature was on the ground, bobbing about
among the ferns and the grass. The moment
it saw them, however, it bounded into a
tree, going swiftly up by jerk after jerk, and
always keeping on the far side of the trunk.</p>
<p>They could just see its bushy tail, first
at one side of the trunk and then, much
higher up, at the other side. When it
reached the top part of the tree, it leapt from
branch to branch in the most daring manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have alarmed the creature,&rdquo; said
Uncle George. &ldquo;But if we sit here quite
still for a little while, Mr Squirrel will get
over his fright. Ah, there he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George handed the glasses to
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell us what you see,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and then Tom and Dolly shall each take
a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sitting up on his hind legs,&rdquo; said
Frank. &ldquo;His great, bushy tail is bent right
over his head. He is holding a little green
thing in his fore-paws. Ah, he is eating it.
Look Dolly!&rdquo; and Frank handed the glasses
to his little sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a lovely little animal,&rdquo; said
Dolly; &ldquo;and what pretty eyes he has. They
are just like a pair of bright, black beads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Tom ought to have the glasses
now,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;He has been
very patient indeed. Come Tom, tell us what
the squirrel is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom took the glasses and looked through
them for a long time. Then he said, &ldquo;He is
a very pretty creature, as Dolly has said.
His colour is rich brown all over, except the
front part of his body, which is a very light
brown, changing almost to white. His tail is
very large and bushy, and his ears are upright
and tufted with brown hair. His fore-paws
are just like little hands. He holds the nut
in them and nibbles it just like a little
monkey. His head is not unlike the rabbit&rsquo;s
head. His teeth are almost exactly like
rabbit&rsquo;s teeth. They are chisel-shaped, and
seem to be very sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, Tom,&rdquo; said his uncle, patting
him on the back, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have
left anything out. Now, let me look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is another one. There are
now two of them,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that one come from?&rdquo; asked
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
his uncle, looking through the glasses. &ldquo;It
seemed to come out of the tree, did it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you children would leave me
nothing to find out; but I see something
which you have missed. Here, Frank, take
the glasses and see if you can find it. Look
at the fork of the tree just below where the
squirrels are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something like a nest,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;I noticed that before, but I thought it was
a rook&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;it is a squirrel&rsquo;s
nest. Rooks build on the very top branches
of trees, and you never see one rook&rsquo;s nest
without a lot of others near it. Besides,
the rook&rsquo;s nest is a rough flat nest, while
this is a round one with a roof on it, and
a hole in the side to let the squirrels out
and in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that other squirrel must have come
out of the nest,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;That is
Mrs Squirrel. She has come out to get some
food, and her little husband will look after
the family while she is away hunting for nuts
and buds and soft green bark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we could get up to that nest, we
should find it to be built of twigs and moss
cleverly woven together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inside is lined with soft warm moss
and dry leaves. We should, most likely, find
four or more tiny squirrels cuddled up together
inside. Blind, naked, helpless things they
are at first. But they soon grow up, and
their long bare tails become bushy. Then
the little mother teaches them to climb and
find food for themselves. Should one of them
fall, she springs down and carries it up to
the nest in her mouth, just as a cat carries
her kittens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By autumn these young squirrels will be
quite as clever as their parents. Autumn is
the squirrel&rsquo;s busy time. He has to prepare
for the long winter, for no nuts are to be
found then. So the squirrel gathers in his
harvest of nuts. These he hides in secret
places buried in the ground. He usually has
more than one storing-place. In fact, he
sometimes has so many that he forgets about
some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never see squirrels in winter,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because the squirrel sleeps the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
winter through. After he has gathered his
harvest, he looks for a snug hole deep under
an old tree-stump. This he lines with
dry leaves and pieces of bark. When the
weather becomes very cold he seeks his
winter nest, coils his body up so that his
great tail is folded almost right round him,
and falls fast asleep. Cold makes him drowsy,
but warmth wakes him up. On a mild
winter&rsquo;s day he wakes up, crawls out of his
hole, and visits his store of nuts. After he
has made a good meal of them, he goes back
to his bed again, and sleeps on until hunger
and mild weather wake him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During autumn the squirrel&rsquo;s coat is
very pretty. It is of a deep, rich brown
colour, and very thick. His tail is then
very large and bushy, and he is quite fat
and sleek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he comes out of his sleeping
quarters in spring he is thin and hungry.
His coat is then a very pale brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do for food in spring?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;There are no nuts to be found
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no, Tom. In spring he robs birds&rsquo;
nests of their eggs, and that is why the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
pretty little squirrel is hunted and shot by
the game-keeper. In spring, too, he feeds on
the tender buds, and so does much damage
to trees and shrubs; that is, if his winter
stores are used up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;that such
a large tail would be very much in the squirrel&rsquo;s
way when climbing and leaping from branch
to branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;his huge tail
is of the greatest use to him in guiding his
body. Without it he could not take such
flying leaps among the tree-tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides this, it often enables him to
escape from his enemies. Many a time the
game-keeper&rsquo;s bullets pass harmlessly through
his fluffy tail, while Mr Squirrel scampers
safely up the tree; and many a time he
escapes from the cat by leaving the tip of his
brush in pussy&rsquo;s claws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many of our trees have been
planted by squirrels. Many a stately oak and
beech tree has sprung from the squirrel&rsquo;s
buried store of acorns and beech nuts. For,
as I have already told you, sometimes he
forgets where he has buried them, or perhaps
fails to find them when the forest is white
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
with snow. So, you see, the little animal is
of some use after all.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7">VII.&mdash;HOW THE FIRE BURNS.</h2>
<p>It was a cold wet day&mdash;so cold and wet that
neither Dolly nor her brothers could venture
out. They had grown tired of reading books
and drawing pictures, and were indeed feeling
very dull. They sat looking at the bright
fire. Uncle George laid down his paper and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us have a lesson. What shall
it be? The rain? The cat? Or shall it be
the cosy fireside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Tell us why the
fire burns, Uncle George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said cheery Uncle George. &ldquo;Just
wait until I get some things from the kitchen.
Come along, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Uncle George and the boys came
back to the room, they brought a lot of
curious articles with them. These were an
empty pickle-bottle, a small saucer, a glass
bell-jar, a large dish, a piece of candle, some
tacks, and a taper.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="caption">THE BALLOON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Uncle George,
&ldquo;we are ready to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He first lighted the piece of
candle and lowered it into the
bottle. It burned for a short
time, then it went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me why it goes
out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want of air,&rdquo; said Tom and Frank at
the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is air in the bottle,&rdquo; said
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not the kind of air the candle
wants,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/illus062.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="496" />
<p class="caption">Candle burning in Open Jar.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a queer answer, Frank. The
candle burned for a time in the bottle before
it went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it used up that part of the air
which makes things burn,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is <i>very</i> good,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>Uncle George then poured some water
into the large dish. He fixed the candle on
a big cork, lighted it and set it floating
on the water. Then he placed the glass
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
bell-jar over it. But first of all he marked
the level of the water on the outside of the
bell-jar.</p>
<p>Very soon the flame of the candle became
small, and at last went
out. Just then the water
inside the bell-jar rose far
up above Uncle George&rsquo;s
mark. He marked this
new level, and asked the
boys if they could tell him
why the water rose in the
jar.</p>
<p>Both Frank and Tom
shook their heads sadly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/illus063.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="594" />
<p class="caption">Candle in Stoppered Jar&mdash;burning.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must explain,&rdquo; said Uncle
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the air has gone,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;How much
of the air has gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank pointed to the space between the
two marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;The water has risen up in the bell-jar to
take the place of the air that has been used
up by the burning of the candle. Where has
this used-up air gone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have gone into the water,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did it not go into the water before
the candle burned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the burning of the candle
has <i>changed</i> this part of the air,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Frank. You are right
again. The burning of the candle has
changed a certain part of the air. It
has, indeed, so changed it that it can
dissolve in water just as if it were sugar or
salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George now poured water into the
outer dish until it was level
with the water inside the
bell-jar. Then he took out
the stopper and pushed a
lighted taper into the bell-jar.
The taper at once
went out.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/illus064.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="599" />
<p class="caption">Candle in Stoppered Jar&mdash;gone out.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This shows us,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that a part of the
air causes things to burn.
The other part of the
air does not. It puts burning things out.
If we blow the fire with a bellows or
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
fan, it burns more brightly and quickly.
Why? Just because we are forcing a
stream of air upon it, and a part of
that stream of air is changed by the
burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George next put some bright iron
tacks in a small dish. He poured some
water out of the large dish, and placed the
bell-jar in the dish. After that he added
water until it was just up to his first mark
on the bell-jar.</p>
<p>Then he floated the dish with the tacks
on the water. Next he wetted the tacks with
water, and then placed the bell-jar over them
and put in the stopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will leave this just
as it is for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys watched the bell-jar every day,
and this is what they saw. The water rose
slowly in the bell-jar. As it rose the bright
tacks turned red with rust. The water rose
higher and the tacks turned redder every
day.</p>
<p>At length it rose to Uncle George&rsquo;s
second mark. It rose no farther, although
left for a whole week.</p>
<p>Then Uncle George called the boys and
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
asked them what had taken place in the
bell-jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tacks have rusted, and some of the
air in the jar has been used up,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much air has been used up?&rdquo;
Uncle George asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just exactly the same as was used up
when we burned the candle,&rdquo; said Tom,
pointing to the top mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see, then,&rdquo; said Uncle George,
&ldquo;what part of the air has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured water into the large dish
until it was level with the water inside
the bell-jar. Then he put a lighted taper
into the bell-jar as before. It went out at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same part of the air as the
burning candle used up,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have found out,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, &ldquo;that when a thing burns it uses up
a certain part of the air; and that when iron
rusts, exactly the same part of the air is used
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first case, the burning of the candle
changed part of the air into a gas which
dissolved in the water. In this case, that
same part of the air has joined up to part of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the iron tacks to form that red powder which
we call <i>rust</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Questions and Exercises.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. How is rust formed?</dt>

<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII.&mdash;THE FIRE-BALLOON.</h2>
<p>One day Uncle George made the children
a fire-balloon. He took twelve strips of
tissue-paper shaped as you see in
the picture. These he pasted neatly
together at the edges so as to
form a kind of bag with a round
opening at the bottom. A ring of
wire was then fixed at the bottom
to keep it firm, and across the
ring was stretched another piece
of wire. This was to hold a dry
sponge by and by.</p>
<p>Uncle George swung the balloon
till it was filled with air. He told
Frank to hold it by the ring while
he heated the air inside the balloon.</p>
<p>This was done by holding the mouth of
the balloon over a piece of rag which had
been dipped in spirits and set on fire.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/illus068.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="400" />
<p class="caption">Strip for Balloon.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Soon Frank felt the balloon rising. He
lifted it up away from the flame, while Uncle
George moved the little sponge along the
wire to the middle of the ring. Then he
soaked the sponge with spirits and set fire
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; said Uncle George; and away
went the balloon, soaring up towards the
sky. Higher and higher it rose, moving with
the wind. The children watched it until at
last it seemed a mere dot in the sky, and
then it went quite out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes the balloon rise up?&rdquo; Dolly
asked, as they returned to the house.</p>
<p>For answer Uncle George took a cork and
held it under a trough of water. When he
let it go, the cork at once rose to the top of
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes the cork rise up?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is lighter than the water,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For just the same reason the balloon
rises in the air,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Our
balloon is only a bag filled with air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the air inside the balloon is lighter
than that outside,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;What did we do
to it to make it lighter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heated it,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what has this taught you?&rdquo; asked
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has taught us,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;that if
we heat air we make it lighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What takes place is this,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;When a small
quantity of air is heated
it swells out and fills a
much larger space than
before. It therefore becomes
much lighter than
the air round about it,
and rises up through it.
Come into the house and
let us take another lesson
from the fire.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Strips pasted together.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have already
learned that the fire in
burning uses up part of the air. After using
up this part of the air, how is it that the fire
does not go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there is always a fresh supply
of air coming into the grate!&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right. If we stand between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
door and the fire we can feel this stream of
air. Something else is taking place in the
grate besides the burning of coal. What is
it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air is being heated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Tom, and what becomes of
the heated air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rises up the chimney, carrying the
smoke with it; just as the heated air in our
balloon rose up, carrying the paper bag with
it,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is really a clever answer, Frank.
Now, can you tell me what makes this
constant stream of cold air from the door to
the fireplace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the cold air rushing in to take the
place of the heated air that has gone up the
chimney,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good indeed, Frank,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;And now I am going to show you
something which will prove all this very
nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then took a saucer and poured some
water into it. He placed a piece of lighted
candle in the middle of the dish and put a
lamp chimney over it. The candle burned for
a few seconds and then went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the candle go out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it has used up that part of the
air which makes things burn,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said Uncle George, and
he began to cut a piece of stout card, shaped
like the letter <b class="large">T</b>, but broader every way.
The upright part fitted into the top of the
lamp chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now going to give the candle
flame a stream of fresh
air,&rdquo; he said, as he fitted
the piece of card into the
chimney.</p>
<p>The candle was again
lit and the chimney placed
over it. This time it did
not go out. It burned
brightly, and the flame
seemed to be blown from
side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very strange,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">

<p class="caption">Draught in Chimney Glass.</p>

<p>Uncle George lit a piece of brown paper.
&ldquo;You will understand it now,&rdquo; he said, as he
held smoking paper near the top of the
chimney.</p>
<p>Then the boys saw a stream of smoke go
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
down one side of the card and come up the
other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see it now,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The card
divides the chimney into two. The air,
heated by the candle flame, rises up one side
of the card, and the cold air goes down the
other side to supply its place, drawing the
smoke with it. The candle does not go out
now, because it gets a constant stream of
fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the balloons, which are large enough
to carry people, fire-balloons?&rdquo; asked Dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; replied Uncle George.
&ldquo;They are filled with a gas that is lighter&mdash;very
much lighter&mdash;than the air. They rise
up easily, and can carry quite a heavy load.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Questions and Exercises.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Take an empty bottle and heat it gently. Now turn it upside down, and place the neck of it in cold water. Why does the water rise in the bottle?</dt>
<dt>2. How is a <i>draught</i> caused?</dt>
<dt>3. Why does a fire burn more brightly on a cold, frosty day, than on a warm summer&rsquo;s day?</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c9">IX.&mdash;THE GULL.</h2>
<p>Frank, Tom, and Dolly had never seen
the sea. Long ago Uncle George had told
them that he would take them, and at last
the time came for them to go.</p>
<p>It was afternoon when they reached the
little sea-side village where they were to
spend a few days. The children were filled
with wonder when they saw the great,
restless ocean. They watched the waves
breaking into white surf, and gathered sea-weeds
and shells on the sandy beach.</p>
<p>By and by they all sat down to rest and
to watch the gulls, for there were many here-about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen birds like these before,
have we not?&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we see them at home
in the fields at spring-time. But are these
the same kind of gulls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom, they are. There are several
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
kinds of gulls. Here we have just two kinds.
The <i>common gull</i> and the <i>tern</i>. You can tell
the one from the other even in the distance
by their mode of flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that one flying
rapidly over the sea? Every now
and then he swoops down to the
water and skims along, almost touching it
with the tips of his long, pointed wings. Do
you know any other bird that flies like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/illus075.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="401" />
<p class="caption">Gull flying.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The swallow flies over the lake at home
something like that,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
tern is very like the swallow both in shape
and in his manner of flight. He differs, however,
in size and colour. He is often called
the &lsquo;sea-swallow,&rsquo; and is the smallest of the
gull family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your swallows at home catch flies and
other insects as they skim through the air.
The &lsquo;sea-swallows&rsquo; live on fish. Every time
they dart down they seize and swallow a
little fish. But it is done so quickly that you
cannot see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gull&rsquo;s flight is quite different. Sometimes
he flies so lazily that he does not seem
to move onwards at all. Then all of a
sudden he darts down into the water to seize
his prey. Sometimes he flaps his great white
wings and wheels swiftly away, flying in
great circles until he is a mere speck in the
distance. The gull has a very sharp eye.
Watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George threw a piece of bread into
the sea. At once about a score of gulls
pounced upon it, screaming loudly. Uncle
George waited until they flew away. Then he
threw them a piece of wood. None of the
gulls came near it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;they can tell a
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
piece of bread from a piece of wood at a
great distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they do not live entirely on fish,&rdquo;
said Frank, as his uncle threw them another
piece of bread.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/illus077.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="634" />
<p class="caption">Gull feeding.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Frank, the gull is by no means
dainty about his food. Nor does he live all
the year round at the sea. Great flocks of
gulls fly inland in spring and autumn. Then
they live on worms, grubs, and whatever else
can be picked up in the fields.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have a fine chance now, boys, of
watching the gull. See, there are some
walking on the sand quite close to us, some
are floating idly on the sea, some are flying
all round us. They think, no doubt, we have
lots of bread for them. Now then, boys, tell
me about the common gull.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/illus080.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="251" />
<p class="caption">Gull at rest on the water.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is a large bird,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;His
body is white in colour, all but his wings
and back. These are of a pale bluish-grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Tom,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;Come on, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a large, greyish-green bill. The
tip of it is hooked in shape, and yellow. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
legs are greenish-grey. The three front toes
of his feet are webbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I can see other gulls
darker in colour. Their bodies are dark
brown and grey above and light brown below.
What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the young gulls, Tom. They
have not got rid of their nest feathers yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do they build their nests?&rdquo; Dolly
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High up on the cliffs, and on lonely
rocky islands. Like the rooks, they all nest
together. The gull&rsquo;s nest is a very simple
thing. It is just a hole scraped in the
ground and covered with dried grass. Here
two, or perhaps three, spotted eggs are laid.
The gull is very fond of her young. She will
not allow them to try to fly from the high
cliff. She carries them one by one on her
back down to the sea, and there teaches
them to swim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some gulls&mdash;the <i>black-headed gull</i>, for
example&mdash;go far inland to nest. These build
their nests on the shores of small hill lakes.
They return to the sea with their young ones
in autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gulls are clever birds. They are bold
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
and active. The wild ocean is their home.
Storms bring no fears for them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises and Questions.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Tell the life-story of the common gull.</dt>
<dt>2. Make a list of all the sea birds you know.</dt>
<dt>3. The common gull has very large wings, curious beak and feet. Can you explain what these are for?</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c10">X.&mdash;DEW, FROST, RAIN.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How is it, Uncle George, that there is
always a clear space between the spout of
the kettle and the puff of steam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Frank that asked the question.
He had been watching the kettle boiling for
a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same with the railway engine,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;There is always a big space
between the funnel and the puff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;But if
you watch carefully, you will notice that the
space between the funnel of the engine and
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the puff of steam is not always of the same
size.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/illus084.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="291" />
<p class="caption">Engine puffing on a hot day.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I have noticed
that the white puff is farther away from
the funnel on a hot day than on a cold
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;Perhaps
you have also noticed that, as the engine
rushes along, it leaves a long white cloud
trailing in the air behind it. Sooner or later
this long white cloud melts away from
sight. It melts away sooner on a hot
day than on a cold day. Where does it
go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;It goes into the air,&rdquo; said Frank; &ldquo;just
as the cloud from this kettle goes into the
air of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Tom,
will you please fetch me a tumbler full of cold
water, and see that the outside of the glass
is quite dry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Tom came back with the glass of
cold water, Uncle George wiped it outside
with a clean dry cloth. When he was sure
that the outside of it was dry, he placed the
tumbler of water on the table in the middle
of the warm room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us try to answer
Frank&rsquo;s question about the clear space
between the spout of the kettle and the
puff of steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; Uncle George went on,
&ldquo;the white puff which we call <i>steam</i> is
not steam at all. We might just as well
call it &lsquo;<i>water-dust</i>.&rsquo; For it is made up of
tiny droplets of water&mdash;so tiny that they
float in air. Steam is water in the form of
gas. Like the air we breathe, it cannot be
seen. In fact, this water-gas forms part of
the air around us. The clear space between
the spout of the kettle and the puff is made
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
up of hot steam. We cannot see it. As it
comes out into the colder air, it is cooled
into the tiny droplets which form the puff. It
is only when cooled into tiny droplets that
we can see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hold any cold object, such as a
knife, in the puff, these water particles run
together and form large drops upon it. The
cloud of water-dust melts away in the room,
as Frank told us. What takes place is this.
The tiny droplets, when spread out into the
warm air, become real steam, or &lsquo;water-gas,&rsquo;
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outside of this tumbler of cold water
was quite dry when I placed it on the table.
Run your finger along it and tell me what
you find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank did so, and said, &ldquo;Why, it is quite
wet now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;it is covered
all over with very small drops of water.
Where did this water come from. It could
not come <i>through</i> the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like dew,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is dew&mdash;<i>real dew</i>,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;The water in the glass is much colder than
the air around it. The film of air next the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
glass is cooled, and the &lsquo;water-gas&rsquo; which
this film of air contains is changed into
water drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth is heated during the day by
the sun, and the layer of air next to it
becomes filled with water-gas. At night the
earth gets cold. The water-gas, if the night
is calm, comes out of the film of air next to
the earth. It settles in the form of tiny drops
on everything around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the earth gets very cold,
the water freezes as it changes from
gas to water, and instead of dew we have
<i>frost</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is why we have frost on the
<i>inside</i> of the window panes in winter,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;The frost
on your window pane is the water-gas of the
warm room changed into particles of ice.
But let us come back to our steam puff. We
spoke about the long white streak of water-dust
which the engine leaves behind it. Do
you know of anything else like that
outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;the clouds far up
in the sky are very like it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;In fact,
the clouds in the sky and the cloud behind
the engine are just the same kind of thing.
They are both made up of tiny particles of
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have learnt that the streak of cloud
left by the steam-engine melts away quickly
on a hot day, also that the puff is farther
from the funnel on a hot day. This shows us
that the warmer the air is, the more water
can it take up and hold. We have also
learnt that warm air is light and rises
up.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens when warm air,
which holds much water-gas, rises up to
the higher and colder parts of the
sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets cooled,&rdquo; answered Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and its water-gas gets cooled too.
Then we can see it as great masses of
water-dust. These masses we call <i>clouds</i>.
If these masses of cloud get further cooled,
the tiny water particles run together to
form great drops&mdash;as they did on the cold
knife. They are now too large and heavy
to float in the air, so they fall to the earth
as <i>rain</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
